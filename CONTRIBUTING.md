# Contributing to BlueLib

## Coding Conventions

<strong>Please Read Before Contributing</strong>

### Naming Conventions
- We use **camelCase** for all variable and method names. This means no spaces or underscores, and each new word after the first begins with a capital letter.
    - **Example**: `thisIsAVariable`, `thisIsAMethod()`.

- All method parameters should start with a lowercase `p` to indicate that they are parameters.
    - **Example**: `String getParameter(String pVariantName, String pParameterKey)`.

### Commenting

- All code should be commented using the `/** * * */` format. This ensures that comments are displayed when users hover over a method, class, or variable, even after the library is compiled. This helps maintain clarity and consistency in the documentation.

  - **Structure**:
      - **Class Descriptions**: 
        - **Start with:** Start the Comment with A(n) {@code privacy/static/final} {@code/link Class/MethodType} [Description of the Class/Method].
        - **Key Methods:** List key methods provided by the class, using bullet points for easy readability.
        - **Author:** If you have contributed to a Method/Class, feel free to add yourself to the author tag.
        - **Since Version:** Use the `@since` tag to indicate the version since which the Method/Class has been available.
        - **Version:** Use the `@version` tag to indicate the version since when the class has last been updated.
            **Example:**
          ```java
            /**
            * A {@code public abstract base class} for managing a collection of {@link #parameters}.
            * <p>
            * This {@code class} provides methods to add, retrieve, remove, and manipulate {@link #parameters} stored as key-value pairs.
            * </p>
            * Key Methods:
            * <ul>
            *   <li>{@link #addParameter(String, Object)} - Adds a parameter to {@link #parameters}.</li>
            *   <li>{@link #getParameter(String)} - Retrieves a parameter from {@link #parameters}.</li>
            *   <li>{@link #removeParameter(String)} - Removes a parameter from {@link #parameters}.</li>
            *   <li>{@link #getAllParameters()} - Returns all parameters in {@link #parameters}.</li>
            *   <li>{@link #containsParameter(String)} - Checks if a parameter exists by its key from {@link #parameters}.</li>
            *   <li>{@link #isEmpty()} - Checks if {@link #parameters} is empty.</li>
            *   <li>{@link #clearParameters()} - Clears all parameters from {@link #parameters}.</li>
            *   <li>{@link #getParameterCount()} - Returns the number of parameters in {@link #parameters}.</li>
            *   <li>{@link #getParameterKeys()} - Returns a set of all parameter keys from {@link #parameters}.</li>
            *   <li>{@link #getParameterValues()} - Returns a collection of all parameter values from {@link #parameters}.</li>
            *   <li>{@link #updateParameter(String, Object)} - Updates the value of an existing parameter in {@link #parameters}.</li>
            * </ul>

        - **Start with:** Start the Comment with A(n) {@code privacy/static/final} {@code/link Class/MethodType} [Description of the Class/Method].
            - **Example for a Method**:
              ```java
              /**
                * A {@code protected static void} that registers entity variants from specified locations.
                * <p>
                * This method attempts to load variants from both mod and datapack locations. It logs status information and
                * handles exceptions that occur during the loading process.
                * </p>
                * <p>
                * Parameters:

                *   <li>{@code pFolderPath} {@link String} - The folder path location within the mod or datapack where variants are stored.</li>
                *   <li>{@code pServer} {@link MinecraftServer} - The server instance of the current world.</li>
                *   <li>{@code pModID} {@link String} - The mod ID used to locate the entity variant resources. (Use your Mod's ID)</li>

                * </ul>

                *
                * @param pFolderPath {@link String} - The folder path location within the mod or datapack where variants are stored.
                * @param pServer     {@link MinecraftServer} - The server instance of the current world.
                * @param pModID      {@link String} - The mod ID used to locate the entity variant resources. (Use your Mod's ID)

                }

        - **Parameters**: Start each parameter description with `{@link TypeOfParameter} - [Comment]`. If the parameter is referenced within the comment, enclose it in a code block using `{@code}`.
            - **Example for Parameters**:
              ```java
              /**
               * A {@link String} that retrieves the value of a custom parameter for a specific variant.
               *
               * @param pVariantName {@link String} - The variant name you want to see the custom parameter of.
               * @param pParameterKey {@link String} - The parameter you want to see.
               * @return The value of the custom parameter identified by {@code pParameterKey}
               * for the variant specified by {@code pVariantName}.
               * @author MeAlam
               * @since 1.0.0
               */
               public String getCustomParameter(String pVariantName, String pParameterKey) {
                    // Method implementation
               }
               ```

- **General Guidelines**:
    - Always ensure that comments are clear, concise, and provide sufficient information to understand the code.
    - When referencing variables or constants, use `{@code}` to wrap them within the comment.
    - Use `{@link}` to refer to classes, methods, or any other Java elements where appropriate.
    - Key Methods: In class-level comments, list out key methods provided by the class, which can help users quickly understand the main functionalities. 
    - Versioning: Include the `@since` tag in both class-level and method-level comments to indicate the version since which the class or method has been available.
    - If you update a Class, please add/update the `@version` to indicate it has been changed.
    - Copyright: Each file should start with `// Copyright (c) BlueLib. Licensed under the MIT License.`
    - Tags: Use `@see` to link to the correct Wiki Documentation page if it exists.
    - Logging: Log every step using `BaseLogger.log`, Always remove the `@EnableLogging` annotation/disable the logging before committing.
    - Error Handling: Always ensure that errors and warnings are logged using appropriate logging levels. Critical steps must be logged at least with `BaseLogger.log(BaseLogLevel.Error)` to keep a trail of execution.

### Deprecation

- If you optimize a method, variable, or class and determine that it is no longer necessary for the library, mark it as `@Deprecated` instead of removing it. This only applies to elements that have been included in previous released versions of the library.
- Include a **strong TODO comment** explaining why it is deprecated and any further action required, such as testing or eventual removal.
- Include an **`@see`** that links to the New Method
- **Example**:
  ```java
  /**
   * Builds and returns a map of the parameters added to this builder. <br><br>
   * Building custom parameters will not go through this method anymore. However, it has not been tested with Multiple Entities and Datapack yet. <br>
   * <strong>TODO: Testing with Multiple Entities and Datapacks required before Deletion/Refactoring.</strong><br>
   * @return A map containing the parameters added to this builder.
   * @author MeAlam
   * @since 1.0.0
   * @see #newMethod()
   */
  @Deprecated
  public Map<String, String> build() {
      return new HashMap<>(parameters);
  }
  ```
